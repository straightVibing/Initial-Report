## Background

### Microbial fuel cells.

- Textbook full of information on the subject
- Useful for providing context to the subject as a whole
- Future ideas
- Written by someone with plenty of real world experience
- Gave definitions and explanations for the commonly found acronyms 

### Microbial Electrochemical and Fuel Cells 2016

- Need to skim over this one
- Will take awhile 
- Could have a look at a journalistic review or something as well

## Review Papers

### Developments in microbial fuel cell modeling

- "Interest has significantly increased in recent decades"
- MFC modelling tends to be neglected
- Introduces the comprehensive type of models
- Anode based 
- Cathode based
- Mentioned parameters that are important:
    - Biofilm thickness
    - Fuel flow rate and concentration
    - Temperature (mentions experimental ranging from 15-40 degrees C)

### A Review on solid oxide fuel cell models

- No useful information whatsoever
- I think I should exclude this from my literature review 

### Models for Microbial Fuel Cells: A critical review

- Biofilm thickness matters
- Different models make different assumptions (no shit)
- Doesn't talk about flow rate at all 
- INDICATION: Models don't focus on temperature or flow rate
- Therefore my title has a USP

## Modelling Papers

### A 1D mathematical model for a microbial fuel cell

- BACKGROUND
- Model correctly predicted how substrate concentration adn temperature affect biofilm thickness and cell performance 
- Modelled temp ranges of 20,30 and 40 degrees
- Still got USP for lower temperatures

### A two-population bio-electrochemical model of a microbial fuel cell

- "Energy from organic waste cannot be recovered using traditional methods"
- This is because it has a complex composition and is usually very dilute
- Model based on anode and focuses on bio-chemical reactions there
    - Therefore, assumes cathode reaction rate is non-limiting
- Demonstrates influence of organic load and external resistance on the MFC power output and long term performance
    - Experiments from 35 - 60 days
    - Adjusted influent acetate concentration between 275 - 2550 mg-S L-1
    - External resistance set between ~10-25 ohms above Rint as well as 5 ohms (below Rint)

- Validated with experimental results
    - Plots of simulated vs measured results show the models follows the patterns of behavior of MFCs
    - Results look pretty good based off graphical comparisons

### Modelling and simulation of two-chamber microbial fuel cell

- "Modelling remain scarce" 
- Claims cathodic reaction is the rate limiting step 
- Flow has an effect on power
- Artificial wastewater
- Useful for scale-up
- Claims reducing feed flow could increase power


### A generalized whole-cell model for wastewater-fed microbial fuel cells

- Mentions a lit review that found COD removal efficiency can be between 5-99% depending on operating conditions.
- Experimental work featured municipal wastewater
- Whole cell model so anode and cathode
- Model assesses after the startup phase of 32 days

### Electricity generation and modeling of microbial fuel cell from continuous beer brewery wastewater

- COD removal efficiency of 40-43% classed as good enough for wastewater treatment
- Low flow-rates considered in experimental work
- Most detailed wastewater description
- Cell operated between 20-28 degrees C

## Experimental Only Work

### Investigation of key parameters influence on performance of direct ethanol fuel cell 

- Not strictly about MFCs
- Was included in research to provide insight on fuel cells as a whole 
- This includes the key parameters that affect them
- Useful to compare to MFCs
- States that higher flow-rates lead to increased performance
- States that higher temperatures increased voltage for a given current density

### Power generation from wastewater using single chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with platinum-free cathodes and pre-colonized anodes

- Operated for 26 weeks
- We don't want biofilm growth on cathode due to increased proton transfer resistance
- Colonized with wastewater - University of Connecticut wastewater treatment plant
- Doesn't talk about flow
- Operated at 30 degrees

### Continuous electricity production from artificial wastewater using a mediator-less microbial fuel cell

- Mediator is used to separate out cathodic and anodic fluids
- Anode volume of 20 ml so probably some scale-up issues
