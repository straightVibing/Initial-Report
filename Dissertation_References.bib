   abstract = {Practical applications of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for wastewater treatment will require operation of these systems over a wide range of wastewater temperatures. MFCs at room or higher temperatures (20–35 °C) are relatively well studied compared those at lower temperatures. MFC performance was examined here over a temperature range of 4–30 °C in terms of startup time needed for reproducible power cycles, and performance. MFCs initially operated at 15 °C or higher all attained a reproducible cycles of power generation, but the startup time to reach stable operation increased from 50 h at 30 °C to 210 h at 15 °C. At temperatures below 15 °C, MFCs did not produce appreciable power even after one month of operation. If an MFC was first started up at temperature of 30 °C, however, reproducible cycles of power generation could then be achieved at even the two lowest temperatures of 4 °C and 10 °C. Power production increased linearly with temperature at a rate of 33 ± 4 mW °C −1, from 425 ± 2 mW m −2 at 4 °C to 1260 ± 10 mW m −2 at 30 °C. Coulombic efficiency decreased by 45% over this same temperature range, or from CE = 31% at 4 °C to CE = 17% at 30 °C. These results demonstrate that MFCs can effectively be operated over a wide range of temperatures, but our findings have important implications for the startup of larger scale reactors where low wastewater temperatures could delay or prevent adequate startup of the system.},

abstract = {To process large volumes of wastewater, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) would require anodophilic bacteria preferably operating at high flow-rates. The effect of flow-rate on different microbial consortia was examined during anodic biofilm development, using inocula designed to enrich either aerobes/facultative species or anaerobes. All MFCs underperformed at high flow-rates in the early stages, however, the aerobic type – following anodic biofilm development – subsequently exhibited more marked improvement. Scanning electron microscopy showed some variation in biofilm formation where clumpy growth was associated with lower power. Over time both power and internal resistance increased for the low flow-rates perhaps explained by an evolving microflora that consequently changed redox potential. An overshoot was observed in power curves, which was attributed to increased internal resistance due to ionic depletion and/or microbial exhaustion. To the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first time that such phenomena are explained from the internal resistance perspective.},

title = {Operation of a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland – Microbial fuel cell treating wastewater under different organic loading rates},
volume = {47},
abstract = {The aim of the present work is to determine whether a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland treating wastewater could act simultaneously as a microbial fuel cell (MFC). Specifically, and as the main variable under study, different organic loading rates were used, and the response of the system was monitored. The installation consisted of a synthetic domestic wastewater-feeding system and a pilot-scale constructed wetland for wastewater treatment, which also included coupled devices necessary to function as an MFC. The wetland worked under continuous operation for 180 d, treating three types of synthetic wastewater with increasing organic loading rates: 13.9 g COD m−2 d−1, 31.1 g COD m−2 d−1, and 61.1 g COD m−2 d−1. The COD removal efficiencies and the cell voltage generation were continuously monitored. The wetland worked simultaneously as an MFC generating electric power. Under low organic loading rates, the wastewater organic matter was completely oxidised in the lower anaerobic compartment, and there were slight aerobic conditions in the upper cathodic compartment, thus causing an electrical current. Under high organic loading rates, the organic matter could not be completely oxidised in the anodic compartment and flowed to the cathodic one, which entered into anaerobic conditions and caused the MFC to stop working. The system developed in this work offered similar cell voltage, power density, and current density values compared with the ones obtained in previous studies using photosynthetic MFCs, sediment-type MFCs, and plant-type MFCs. The light/darkness changes caused voltage fluctuations due to the photosynthetic activity of the macrophytes used (Phragmites australis), which affected the conditions in the cathodic compartment.
[Display omitted]
•A wastewater treatment constructed wetland worked as a microbial fuel cell.•Low organic loading rates allowed depurating and also obtaining electrical power.•High organic loadings caused anaerobic conditions and stopped electricity production.•The power generation was similar to several reported natural technologies.},

One of the most promising features of the microbial fuel cell is its application to generate power from wastewater, and its use in the treatment of water to remove contaminants, making it a very sustainable source of power generation that can feasibly find application in rural areas where providing more conventional sources of power is often difficult. The book explores, in detail, both the technical aspects and applications of this technology, and was written by an international team of experts in the field who provide an introduction to microbial fuel cells that looks at their electrochemical principles and mechanisms, explains the materials that can be used for the various sections of the fuel cells, including cathode and anode materials, and provides key analysis of microbial fuel cell performance looking at their usage in hydrogen production, waste treatment, and sensors, amongst other applications.},

In the present study, performance of microbial fuel cell (MFC) has been modeled using three potential artificial intelligence (AI) methods such as multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), artificial neural network and support vector regression. The effect of two input factors namely, temperature and ferrous sulfate concentrations on the output voltage were studied independently during two operating conditions (before and after start-up) using the three AI models. The data is randomly divided into training and testing samples containing 80% and 20% sets respectively and then trained and tested by three AI models. Based on the input factor, the proposed AI models predict output voltage of MFC at two operating conditions. Out of three methods, the MGGP method not only evolve model with better generalization ability but also represents an explicit relationship between the output voltage and input factors of MFC. The models generated by MGGP approach have shown an excellent potential to predict the performance of MFC and can be used to gain better insights into the performance of MFC.},

   abstract = {[Display omitted] •A novel holistic MFC model was applied to predict wastewater treatment performance.•The model couples the bioelectrochemical-electrical model with the well-known ASM1.•Cathode-linked gas–liquid mass transport and fouling kinetics were considered.•R-PWM technique was used as a tool for real-time parameter estimation.•Most sensitive parameters were optimized using the Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain method. A comprehensive mathematical modeling of wastewater-fed microbial fuel cells (MFC) demands an in-depth process understanding of the main electrical and bioelectrochemical interactions at both electrodes. In this study, a novel holistic simulation approach using a low-parameterized model was applied to predict pollutant transport, conversion, and electrical processes of mixed-culture single-chamber MFCs. The proposed whole-cell model couples the combined bioelectrochemical-electrical model with the well-established Activated Sludge Model No.1 (ASM1) and specific equations from ASM2. The cathodic gas–liquid mass transfer of oxygen and free ammonia nitrogen was described in terms of a diffusion film model, while the diminishing diffusivity due to salt deposits was considered via a fouling decline kinetic model. The predictive capacity of the model was validated using experimental data of three continuous-flow single-chamber MFCs operated with municipal wastewater for 150 days. Electrochemical parameters were estimated in real-time by pulse-width modulated connection of the external electrical load resistance. Following a sensitivity analysis, the most relevant model parameters were optimized through the Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain method using the adaptive Metropolis algorithm. All other parameters were adopted from benchmark simulation studies. The simulated relative contributions of aerobic carbon oxidation, denitrification, electrogenesis, and methanogenesis to the total COD removal rate were 21–22%, 44–45%, 21–25%, and 9–14%. Overall, the presented whole-cell model is able to successfully predict the evolution of electricity generation, methane production, and effluent concentrations (soluble COD and total ammonia nitrogen) under different hydraulic conditions and organic loading rates.},

Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer promising prospects in the field of renewable energy since green electrical power is produced by the microbial activity and wastewater is treated simultaneously. MFCs are complex devices whose study requires an interdisciplinary approach as many processes of a diverse nature are involved. Interest in MFC has significantly increased in recent decades, and much scientific effort has been dedicated to making this technology more efficient. However, the focus has been on experimental work, and MFC modeling has tended to be neglected, and only recently has it received more attention with a consequent rise in the number of new MFC models available. Modeling is an effective tool for gaining a better understanding of MFCs, since it has many advantages in terms of cost and time savings. The present article looks at the state of modeling and simulation of MFCs and outlines and classifies the most prominent models described in the literature. Since modeling approaches can vary greatly from case to case, this work will summarize the advantages and drawbacks of each approach, including not only models based on classic approaches but also those using mathematical optimization techniques.},

   abstract = {► Biofilms growing on anodes and cathodes posed two-side effects on power generation. ► Thick biofilms reduced the power generation in a long-term operation. ► The MFCs with Pt-free cathodes achieved similar power generation as that with the Pt-based cathodes. ► The low-cost and stable operation of Pt-free biocathodes is promising for the real-world application. The effects of biofilm growth on anode and cathode surfaces on the power generation from wastewater in single chamber microbial fuel cells (SCMFCs) were investigated in this paper. SCMFCs with the clean/pre-colonized anodes and the platinum-based/platinum-free cathodes were operated for 26 weeks. The pre-colonized (4-week colonization) anodes were tested with three areas (2, 10 and 40cm2) and compared with the MFCs started with clean and sterilized anodes. The power generation of MFCs increased with the anode areas (2–10cm2), but kept a plateau for the anode area of 40cm2. The MFCs with the clean anodes had lower power generation (268mW/m2) than those with the pre-colonized anodes (801mW/m2) in the first week of operation. With the operation proceeding to 4–5 weeks, the power generation of the clean anodes and pre-colonized anodes became similar and stabilized at 470mW/m2. In terms of cathode performance, platinum-free cathodes (carbon cloth, surface area: 5cm2) and platinum-based cathodes (Pt loading: 0.5mgPt/cm2, surface area: 5cm2) were compared. The Pt-based cathodes had higher power generation (330mW/m2) than those of the Pt-free cathodes (253mW/m2) at the startup period, but the difference quickly vanished after a few weeks of operation. This study demonstrated that the advantage of the MFCs with the pre-colonized anodes and platinum-based cathodes disappeared after 3–5 weeks of operation due to the thick biofilm growth on anodes and the aerobic biofilm formation on cathodes. Pt-free cathodes with controlled biofilm growth are promising for low-cost materials, stable power generation and long-term operation of MFCs.},

A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a novel biotechnological system able to simultaneously produce renewable energy and perform wastewater treatment. The aim of this work was to study the effect of configurational parameters, such as membrane area, anode electrode size and cell design and operating conditions, such as flow rate and shear stress on the MFC performance toward its optimization. A synthetic wastewater based on a dairy industry effluent and pure culture of Lactobacillus pentosus was used. For each condition tested, the MFC performance was evaluated in terms of power density, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate and the characteristics of the L. pentosus biofilm attached to the anode electrode (biomass amount, cell viability and total and extracellular proteins and polysaccharides). The maximum power density, 8.09±1.52mWm−2, was achieved with the lower flow rate tested (0.05Lh−1). For all the conditions tested the COD removal rates were between 56% and 61%. The different configurational and operating conditions tested influenced the energy production and the biofilm characteristics. However, the wastewater treatment efficiency was not considerably affected. L. pentosus proved to be capable of treating a dairy wastewater and produce electricity without the presence of a mediator. Further investigation needs to be done to improve the MFC overall performance.},

Three categories of modelling based on the white-, the black- and the grey-box approaches are introduced. The white-box model includes two types, i.e. physical model and equivalent circuit model based on EIS technique. The black-box model is based on artificial intelligence and its realisation relies mainly on experimental data. The grey-box model is more flexible: it is a physical representation but with some parts being modelled empirically. Validation of models is discussed and a hierarchical modelling approach involving all of three modelling methods is briefly mentioned, which gives an overview of the design for implementing a generic diagnostic tool on SOFC system.},

A single air-cathode MFC was constructed, carbon fiber was used as anode and diluted brewery wastewater (COD = 626.58 mg/L) as substrate. The MFC displayed an open-circuit voltage of 0.578 V and a maximum power density of 9.52 W/m 3 (264 mW/m 2). Using the model based on polarization curve, various voltage losses were quantified. At current density of 1.79 A/m 2, reaction kinetic loss and mass transport loss both achieved to 0.248 V; while ohmic loss was 0.046 V. Results demonstrated that it was feasible and stable for producing bioelectricity from brewery wastewater; while the most important factors which influenced the performance of the MFC are reaction kinetic loss and mass transport loss.},

A mediatorless microbial fuel cell was developed using Escherichia coli as the active bacterial component with synthetic wastewater of potato extract as the energy source. The two-chamber fuel cell, with a relation of volume between anode and cathode chamber of 8:1, was operated in batch mode. The response was similar to that obtained when glucose was used as the carbon source. The performance characteristics of the fuel cell were evaluated with two different anode and cathode shapes, platinised titanium strip or mesh; the highest maximum power density (502mWm−2) was achieved in the microbial fuel cell with mesh electrodes. In addition to electricity generation, the MFC exhibited efficient treatment of wastewater so that significant reduction of initial oxygen demand of wastewater by 61% was observed. These results demonstrate that potato starch can be used for power generation in a mediatorless microbial fuel cell with high removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand.
► Electricity was harvested from a mediatorless microbial fuel cell with E. coli. ► Electricity from potato starch was generated at a maximum power density of 502mWm−2. ► A similar output was obtained when glucose was used as the carbon source. ► Chemical Oxygen Demand removal of the MFC reached 60.8±5.2%. ► Photographs showing microbial communities attached on anode surface were taken.},

A recognition of needs of efficient development methods based on multidisciplinary research becomes crucial for the optimization of MFCs. Modeling of MFCs is an effective way for not only gaining a thorough understanding of the effects of operation conditions on the performance of power generation but also becomes of essential interest to the successful implementation of MFCs. The MFC models encompass the underlying reaction process and limiting factors of the MFC. The models come in various forms, such as the mathematical equations or the equivalent circuits. Different modeling focuses and approaches of the MFC have emerged. In this study, we present a state of the art of MFCs modeling; the past modeling methods are reviewed as well. Models and modeling methods are elaborated on based on the classification provided by Mechanism-based models and Application-based models. Mechanisms, advantages, drawbacks, and application fields of different models are illustrated as well. We exhibit a complete and comprehensive exposition of the different models for MFCs and offer further guidance to promote the performance of MFCs. •Mechanisms, advantages, drawbacks, and applications of different MFC models are discussed.•Mechanism-based and Application-based taxonomy of MFC models is presented.•Different modeling approaches to the MFC are reviewed.},

   abstract = {Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) offer great promise for simultaneous treatment of wastewater and energy recovery. While past research has been based extensively on experimental studies, modelling and simulation remains scarce. A typical MFC shares many similarities with chemical fuel cells such as direct ascorbic acid fuel cells and direct methanol fuel cells. Therefore, an attempt is made to develop a MFC model similar to that for chemical fuel cells. By integrating biochemical reactions, Butler–Volmer expressions and mass/charge balances, a MFC model based on a two-chamber configuration is developed that simulates both steady and dynamic behaviour of a MFC, including voltage, power density, fuel concentration, and the influence of various parameters on power generation. Results show that the cathodic reaction is the most significant limiting factor of MFC performance. Periodic changes in the flow rate of fuel result in a boost of power output; this offers further insight into MFC behaviour. In addition to a MFC fuelled by acetate, the present method is also successfully extended to using artificial wastewater (solution of glucose and glutamic acid) as fuel. Since the proposed modelling method is easy to implement, it can serve as a framework for modelling other types of MFC and thereby will facilitate the development and scale-up of more efficient MFCs.},

abstract = {Bioelectricity generation from biodegradable compounds using microbial fuel cells (MFCs) offers an opportunity for simultaneous wastewater treatment. This study evaluated the synergy of electricity generation by the MFC while reducing pollutants from sugar beet processing wastewater (SBPW). A simple dual-chamber MFC was constructed with inexpensive materials without using catalysts. Raw SBPW was diluted to several concentrations (chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 505 to 5,750 mg L
) and fed as batch-mode into the MFC without further modification. A power density of 14.9 mW m
as power output was observed at a COD concentration of 2,565 mg L
. Coulombic efficiency varied from 6.21% to 0.73%, indicating diffusion of oxygen through the cation exchange membrane and other methanogenesis and fermentation processes occurring in the anode chamber. In this study, >97% of the COD and up to 100% of the total suspended solids removals were observed from MFC-treated SBPW. Scanning electron microscopy of anode indicated that a diverse community of microbial consortia was active for electricity generation and wastewater treatment. This study demonstrated that SBPW can be used as a substrate in the MFC to generate electricity as well as to treat for pollutant removal.},

The performance of the chitosan/biodegradable copolymer membrane was evaluated in bioelectricity production with brewery effluent as an anolyte in a carbon electrode microbial fuel cell. Additionally, the competence of the prepared blend proton exchange membrane is compared with the commercial Nafion 117 membrane and Agar salt bridge in separate microbial fuel cell units with the same effluent and electrodes. At neutral pH, the effect of adding metabolites such as glucose and acetate to the anolyte was also investigated.

abstract = {Dissimilatory metal reducing organisms play key roles in the biogeochemical cycle of metals as well as in the durability of submerged and buried metallic structures. The molecular mechanisms that support electron transfer across the microbe-metal interface in these organisms remain poorly explored. It is known that outer membrane proteins, in particular multiheme cytochromes, are essential for this type of metabolism, being responsible for direct and indirect, via electron shuttles, interaction with the insoluble electron acceptors. Soluble electron shuttles such as flavins, phenazines, and humic acids are known to enhance extracellular electron transfer. In this work, this phenomenon was explored. All known outer membrane decaheme cytochromes from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 with known metal terminal reductase activity and a undecaheme cytochrome from Shewanella sp. HRCR-6 were expressed and purified. Their interactions with soluble electron shuttles were studied using stopped-flow kinetics, NMR spectroscopy, and molecular simulations. The results show that despite the structural similarities, expected from the available structural data and sequence homology, the detailed characteristics of their interactions with soluble electron shuttles are different. MtrC and OmcA appear to interact with a variety of different electron shuttles in the close vicinity of some of their hemes, and with affinities that are biologically relevant for the concentrations typical found in the medium for this type of compounds. All data support a view of a distant interaction between the hemes of MtrF and the electron shuttles. For UndA a clear structural characterization was achieved for the interaction with AQDS a humic acid analog. These results provide guidance for future work of the manipulation of these proteins toward modulation of their role in metal attachment and reduction.},

abstract = {Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an environmentally friendly technology for electricity harvesting from a variety of substrates. Microorganisms used as catalysts in the anodic chamber, which are termed as electricigens, play a major role in the operation of MFCs. This review provides an introduction to the currently identified electricigens on their taxonomical groups and electricity producing abilities. The mechanism of electron transfer from electricigens to electrode is highlighted. The performances of pure culture and mixed communities are compared particularly. It has been proved that the electricity generation capacity and the ability to adapt to the complex environment of MFC systems constructed by pure microbial cultures are less than the systems constructed by miscellaneous consortia. However, pure cultures are useful to clarify the electron transfer mechanism at the microbiological level and further reduce the complexity of mixed communities. Future research trends of electricigens in MFCs should be focused on screening, domestication, modification and optimization of multi-strains to improve their electrochemical activities. Although the MFC techniques have been greatly advanced during the past few years, the present state of this technology still requires to be combined with other processes for cost reduction.},

   abstract = {Bioenergy is a renewable energy that plays an indispensable role in meeting today's ever increasing energy needs. Unlike biofuels, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) convert energy harvested from redox reactions directly into bioelectricity. MFCs can utilize low‐grade organic carbons (fuels) in waste streams. The oxidation of the fuel molecules requires biofilm catalysis. In recent years, MFCs have also been used in the electrolysis mode to produce bioproducts in laboratory tests. MFCs research has intensified in the past decade and the maximum MFCs power density output has been increased greatly and many types of waste streams have been tested. However, new breakthroughs are needed for MFCs to be practical in wastewater treatment and power generation beyond powering small sensor devices. To reduce capital and operational costs, simple and robust membrane‐less MFCs reactors are desired, but these reactors require highly efficient biofilms. Newly discovered conductive cell aggregates, improved electron transport through hyperpilation via mutation or genetic recombination and other advances in biofilm engineering present opportunities. This review is an update on the recent advances on MFCs designs and operations. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry},
